## Service Management Script for Docker Compose Setup

This repository contains a script to manage Docker Compose services for a MediaWiki setup. The script simplifies the process of starting, reloading, restarting, and stopping the services, ensuring a smooth and automated workflow.

### Directory Structure

- **docker-compose/**
  - **wiki/**: Directory where `LocalSettings.php` should be placed after the initial setup.
  - **init/**: Contains SQL queries or scripts required to initialize the databases for the services.

### Script Usage

The management script, `service.sh`, provides commands to start, reload, restart, and stop the Docker Compose services. 

### Commands

- `start`: Initializes and starts the Docker Compose services. After the initial setup, ensure that `LocalSettings.php` is downloaded and placed in the `docker-compose/wiki/` directory. This command will be used for the first-time setup.
- `reload`: Reloads the Docker Compose services. Use this command after placing `LocalSettings.php` in the `docker-compose/wiki/` directory to apply the configuration.
- `restart`: Restarts all the Docker Compose services. Useful for applying any changes or updates.
- `stop`: Stops the Docker Compose services. Use this to stop the running containers.

### How to Run

1. **Ensure the script is executable**: 
   ```bash
   chmod +x service.sh
2. **Run the script with desired arguments**:
    ```bash
    bash service.sh [command]

Replace [command] with one of the supported arguments: start, reload, restart, or stop.

### Detailed Steps
1. **start the service**
   ```bash
   bash service.sh start
This command will initialize and start the services using Docker Compose. Itâ€™s the initial setup command. After running this, ensure to download and place the LocalSettings.php file in the docker-compose/wiki/ directory.

2. **reload the service**
   ```bash
     bash service.sh reload
Once `LocalSettings.php` is in the correct location, use this command to reload the services and apply the new configuration.

3. **Restart the service**
   ```bash
     bash service.sh restart
This command stops and then starts all the services, useful for applying updates or changes.

4. **Stop the service**
   ```bash
     bash service.sh stop
This command will stop all running Docker Compose services.

# Example Workflow

## Initial Setup:

1. Run `bash service.sh start` to start the services.
2. Setup wiki and Download `LocalSettings.php` and place it in the `docker-compose/wiki/` directory.
3. Run `bash service.sh reload` to apply the configuration.

## Managing Services:

1. Use `bash service.sh stop` to stop the services when not needed.
2. Use `bash service.sh restart` to apply changes or updates.

## Directory Overview

- **docker-compose/wiki/**: After the initial setup, `LocalSettings.php` should be placed here.
- **docker-compose/init/**: Contains SQL scripts to initialize databases required by the services.

## Accessing to the Application
The default domains set for the applications are as follows:
- **mediawiki**: [http://wiki.live-in-europe.org](http://wiki.live-in-europe.org)
- **flarum**: [http://flarum.live-in-europe.org](http://flarum.live-in-europe.org)

These URLs are set for test purposes. In order to change the domains, Nginx config file at `nginx/conf/app.conf` should be updated correspondingly.

### NOTE:
 `docker compose restart webserver` is required after applying new configurations.
 
## Accessing the Applications

- **MediaWiki**: Access the application at [http://127.0.0.1:1234](http://127.0.0.1:1234)
- **Flarum**: Access the application at [http://127.0.0.1:5678](http://127.0.0.1:5678)

## Database Configuration for application installation
- **host**: *database*
- **user**: *adminuser*
- **password**: *123456*

## Important Notes

- Ensure that the `LocalSettings.php` file is correctly downloaded and placed in the `docker-compose/wiki/` directory after the initial start.
- The script simplifies managing Docker Compose services but assumes that the Docker and Docker Compose environments are correctly set up on your system.
- **Production Consideration**: It is important to remove port mappings (`1234:80`, `5678:80`, etc.) from the Docker Compose configuration before deploying to production to avoid exposing internal services to the public.
